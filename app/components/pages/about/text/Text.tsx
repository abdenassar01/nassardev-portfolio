          When I am not writing code I love to spend time with my family and friends in Lagos. I hang around a couple of DAOs on Discord and actively contribute to the MoonShot Collective work-stream of GitcoinDAO and I love to read fiction and non-fiction books, watch sci-fi movies and play games on my playstation console.
